# Application form for starting a SIG


## What will be the name of the SIG
NumTech SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
- Nicolas Renaud
- Felipe Zapata

## What is the SIGâ€™s mission?
Gather, disseminate and extend knowledge about numerical techniques within the eScience Center

## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/NumTech-sig

## What Office group will the SIG use?
NumTech-SIG

## Plans for period until end of April 2020
In this section, list what plans you have for this SIG. Describe each plan according to the following format: 

- **Regular meetings**: we will still have one meeting a month where member will present their project/techniques to disseminate their knowledge
- **Sprint #1 : Jacobi-Davidson Eigen Solver in Python**: Using the generalization budget of some energy projects, we are planning to developp a Pyhton module that implement the Jacobi-Davidson eigenvalue solver (and related techniques). We need to coordinate with the Tech Leads and the PI of the corresponding projects. This could take place between Fall2019 and Spring2020.
- **Sprint #2 : Jacobi-Davidson in Eigen**: If the Sprint #1 is successfull we will reiterate with a sprint to include JD techniques in the C++ package Eigen. This will most likely take place in Spring 2020.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
	- Reusable libraries implementing different numerical techniques (eigen solvers, linear solvers, ....) in different languages (Python, C++, Fortran, ...)
	- Demos on how to use these libraries
	- Demos related to other NumTech related project (DeepQMC)
