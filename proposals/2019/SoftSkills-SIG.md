- topical session: Presenter talks about a soft skills topic, providing the SIG with information about a certain soft skill, e.g. a framework that can be used to improve communication or the understanding of communication.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?

- a collection of soft skills material
- possibly changes or additions to documents and procedures at the Center, like the code of conduct, or the way meetings are done
