# Application form for starting a SIG

## What will be the name of the SIG
GPU Computing SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
 - Ben van Werkhoven
 - Alessio Sclocco

## What is the SIG’s mission?
Our mission is to enrich the knowledge of our members in the topic of accelerated computing, with a focus on GPUs, and to do so we organize meetings to discuss recent developments in technology and research. We focus on technologies and expertise that are required to accelerate scientific computations, specifically by rewriting and optimizing the compute-intensive parts of the code. Furthermore, we maintain close connections with the broad research community by actively participating in national-level workshops, by inviting external speakers at the SIG meetings, and having students present their research projects. We are also involved in the teaching GPU programming courses, and represent the first contact point for eScience engineers having issues with performance-critical code.

## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/gpu-sig

## What Office group will the SIG use?
GPU Computing

## Plans for period until end of April 2020
August 2019 - Alessio and Ben gave a full day GPU Programming course as part of the BQ-minded Summer school at the University of Antwerp. We will likely receive an invite to give another more advanced course in next year’s summer school, and we were invited to give the same course again for the VisionLab research group at the University of Antwerp (date to be decided).

Fall 2019 - Ben is one of the co-organisers of the national NIRICT GPU Workshop series, which will organize another workshop and tutorial day later this year. The NIRICT GPU Workshops are about once or twice a year and are regularly attended by and contributed to by members of the GPU Computing SIG.

Fall 2019/Spring 2020 - Ben plans to teach an internal GPU programming training course for all eScience Research Engineers at the eScience center, possibly open to project partners/others as well, need to discuss with Tom Bakker. Members of the GPU Computing SIG will attend and/or help out with teaching. It would be good to not have the date too close to the NIRICT GPU tutorial, so we could also delay this to spring 2020.

November 21, 2019 - Hanno will give a demo at the eScience Symposium on self-calibration using SAGECal on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Hanno did a practice demo at the GPU Computing SIG meeting of 19-09-2019, and the SIG members gave Hanno advice on how to monitor the performance of the CPU code, and solve performance issues.

December 1st, 2019 - CORTEX project will start, Ben (co-applicant of the proposal) will work on this and lead the project from the NLeSC side. Alessio will also work on the project. In this project we will actively research the topic of GPU program optimization and auto-tuning and of course share that knowledge through the GPU Computing SIG.

Spring 2020 - two 6 person-month projects will start as part of the ESiWACE2 project. These projects will be about porting Weather and/or Climate models to GPUs. From the GPU Computing SIG, Gijs van den Oord, Victor Azizi, Alessio and Ben will work on these projects and actively share their findings and experiences with the SIG.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
A demo at the eScience Symposium by Hanno Spreeuw
National-level tutorials/workshops through the NIRICT GPU Workshop series
Training courses on GPU Programming
