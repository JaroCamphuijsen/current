# Application form for starting a SIG

## What will be the name of the SIG

Software Sustainability SIG
(BTW _software sustainability_ includes _software engineering_)

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?

- Jurriaan H. Spaaks (https://github.com/jspaaks)
- Carlos Martinez-Ortiz (https://github.com/c-martinez)

## What is the SIG’s mission?
<!--
The mission of your SIG should contribute to the organization’s mission.
-->

- Sharing knowledge about best practices regarding research software development,
e.g. in relation (but not limited) to:
   - code quality
   - version control
   - software engineering
   - testing
   - continuous integration
   - software citation
   - FAIR software
- Act as a signpost for questions regarding sustainability of research software

## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?

https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/software-sustainability

## What Office group will the SIG use?
Software Sustainability (to be created)

## Plans for period until end of April 2020
<!--
In this section, list what plans you have for this SIG. Describe each plan according to the following format:

- **title**: context 1
- **title 2**: context 2
- etc

For title, describe your plan in just a few words. For context, describe briefly and concretely what is the plan.
-->

The following should be interpreted as a Could-do list:

- **Improve the process by which we develop research software** Formulate and
  subsequently execute the Netherlands eScience Center vision on how to improve
  the day to day practice of developing research software. On the one hand,
  there are people in the Center who know how to develop research software
  'properly'; on the other hand, whether things are done properly in practice
  depends largely on the skill and willingness of the (one) engineer that is
  working on a given project. Furthermore, it is unclear how much insight line
  managers have into sustainability aspects of the software we develop; it may
  depend largely on who the line manager is, and how they balance sustainability
  aspects with doing just enough to be able to write the next paper. We should
  figure out what is keeping our engineers from striving to implement NLeSC
  mission, as opposed to the PI's mission. One possibility of getting a handle
  on this is through interviews.
- **Develop content for _Five recommendations for FAIR software_ website**
  Together with DANS, NLeSC is developing a website with recommendations for
  researchers and RSEs about good practices for developing research software.
  This SIG will propose and evaluate the content for said site.
- **Organize NL-RSE workshop on FAIR software** The SIG will organize a workshop
  at the NL-RSE Conference, where participants can bring their own software and
  make it more FAIR during the session.
- **Organize a Five recommendations compliance sprint** Make an inventory of our
  own compliance with the Five recommendations site.
- **Organize internal training**: organize internal workshops to promote good
  practices (following the guide).
- **Organize reviews** The SIG will organize short code reviews during which we
  will evaluate sustainability aspects of selected repositories, as used in our
  projects.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
<!--

- Five recommendations for FAIR software site content
- log of activity
- Inventory of whether the software we produce meets the (minimal) standard set
  by the _Five recommendations_ website
- Updated release of the guide
- Internal workshops
