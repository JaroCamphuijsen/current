## Plans for period until end of April 2020
- **Business (international) travelling** 

Discourage traveling

Discourage using airplanes 

Compensate CO2 

 

- **Office energy consumption**

Make sure it is impossible to have the Airco or radiator on while also having the window open. 

Block the hottest setting of the radiators and hand out NLeSC sweaters for people that need more insulation. 

Consider energy use of computation

 

- **Office resource consumption**

Get rid of the whole printing forms just to sign them and then scanning them again 

Make sure old furniture and devices are not thrown away but reused.  

 

- **Commuting** 

Reflect on necessity of weekly travelling to PI location. A two monthly sprint may be much more efficient. 

Encourage cycle /walking commuting and/or discourage car commuting. 

  

- **Food**

Ban all food products from lunch that contain palm oil (=rain forest cuts),  

Less animal products at lunch 

Organic products 

 

 - **Investments**

Check that the Bank NLeSC uses is climate friendly or switch to a bank like Triodos or ASN. Same for other financial service providers. 

 

- **Green NLeSC process and outreach**

Collaborate with others at science park to collect knowledge and share experiences around this topic. 

Think about how we can make sure the whole escience center feels involved in this and people don't just feel that they get restrictions on their personal preferences (like eating meat, feeling warm and traveling by car) by "those annoying green extremists" 

Collaborate with the IS-enes project’s Carbon Footprint group 

Agree on how to implement the changes mentioned above 


## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
