# Application form for starting a SIG


## What will be the name of the SIG
Agile SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
- Yifat Dzigan

## What is the SIGâ€™s mission?
The mission of our SIG will be to introduce, teach and train in Agile methodologies. We want Agile to become common knowledge in the center and aim for engineers/MT/DT/Operations to use it when appropriate. This will contribute to the team work within the center and to the restructuring and scaling phase we will enter in the near future.

- **Agile/Scrum in-house training**: Generic Agile or Scrum overview course given by a professional (for example, Xebia)
- **Experience/implementation/problems-solving sessions**: Scrum masters, development team, projects owners will share their problems/questions and we discuss them.
