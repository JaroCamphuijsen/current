# Application form for starting a SIG


## What will be the name of the SIG
Advanced Reinforcement Learning

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
- Christiaan Meijer
- Florian Huber

## What is the SIG’s mission?
Bring our knowledge up to speed in field of reinforcement learning. This is a field where some of us have been experts in. We need to put effort to keep calling ourselves experts in this important subfield of machine learning.

## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/reinforcement-learning-course

## What Office group will the SIG use?
None, no need for a Group of 3 to 4 people

## Plans for period until end of April 2020
- Follow course 'Advanced AI: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python': We are following the course at https://www.udemy.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-python/. We were doing this with a frequency of a 1 or 2 hours every 2 or 3 weeks. Before the summer we hit a bump and vacations were coming up so the activities were put on hold. We intent to continue with a similar pace as before the stop. The course will take about half a year tops in that case.
- Disband: There is probably no need to continue this SIG when we finished the course.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
We can have a nice animation of some agent learning to balance a pole on a cart, or maybe even play some simple Atari game. This could make for some nice 'demo', maybe without a scientific narrative, but still interesting from a machine learning perspective.
We would also keep the expertise if a project arises that requires learning agents.
We will train our deep learning skills in general as reinforcement learning is a challenging setting to apply deep learning in.
