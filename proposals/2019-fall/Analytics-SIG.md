# Application form for starting a SIG


## What will be the name of the SIG
Analytics (former Statistics-SIG)

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
- Sarah Alidoost
- Johan Hidding
- Dafne van Kuppevelt

## What is the SIGâ€™s mission?
The mission of this SIG in the broadest sense, is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone. 

## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/Statistics-SIG

## What Office group will the SIG use?
statistics@esciencecenter.nl

## Plans for period until end of April 2020

- **Monthly Presentations**: Continuing the monthly meetings with 45min presentations. We aim for monthly interactive meetings where diverse speakers from in and outside the NLeSC present a topic. The topic can be either an introduction into a technique or an application where advanced analytical methods played a pivotal role. This is a continuation of the previous activities in the Statistics SIG. 
- **Course**: Following a course on a more specific topic in two-weekly meetings.This can be organized as a series of seminars. Alternatively, if presentations or any course material are available online, we use them. The activities in the second mode will always be presented in a plenary (all NLeSC) Thursday lunch meeting.


## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
Until April 2020 we expect the following output:

- Contributing to Zenodo:
    - ca. 6 presentations
- Presenting one demo at the NLeSC symposium
- Keeping a portfolio of expertise in analytics at NLeSC
