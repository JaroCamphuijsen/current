## What is SIGâ€™s mission?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The mission of this SIG in the broadest sense, is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.

## SIG outcomes in the period April 2020 - October 2020 (for existing SIGs)


## Plans for the period until the end of April 2021

- **Network Science course**: We continue working on the book [A first course in network science](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-first-course-in-network-science/EE22722F27519D8BB1443C7225C57BAF)
- **Monthly presentations**: Continuing the monthly meetings with 30min presentations. We aim for monthly interactive meetings where diverse speakers from in and outside the center present a topic. The topic can be either an introduction into a technique or an application where advanced analytical methods played a pivotal role. Some of the planned/upcoming meetings are:

Some of the topics we want to explore are:
- Network Science
- Data cleaning for AI, e.g. filling missing values

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?
- Internal training on a specific topic (mentioned above)
- Sharing knowledge on statistics (at basic/intermediate level)
- Transfer of knowledge by inviting external speakers
