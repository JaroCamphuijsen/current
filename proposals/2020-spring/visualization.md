## Plans for the period until the end of October 2020
**Project implementation**
We aim to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in running and new projects of the members of this SIG and report on that through blogs or visualization (see output). A few examples of running projects where visualizations play a role are:

- The RECEIPT project: Will run for 4 years, and will provide ample opportunities for the application of knowledge in the fields this SIG supports. Of special note are Data Journalism skills and techniques.

- eWaterCycle II: Makes extensive use of visualizations in the different phases of its runtime. Examples include the [explorer](https://explore.ewatercycle.org/), the [forecast](https://forecast.ewatercycle.org/) and analysis and visualization of results(future work).

- Algorithmic Geo Visualization (Thijs van Lankveld)

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Presentations/blogs on the attendance of related conferences.
- Presentations/blogs or (guide additions) on lessons learned/best practices in data visualization.
- Organize open workshops (together with SURF) on several topics in visualization.
