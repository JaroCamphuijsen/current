# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG
<!--  Pick a name that reflects the goal of the SIG.
      Make it specific enough to be meaningful.
      But broad enough to give you room  to shift focus when necessary  --> Accelerated Computing SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
<!--  Please make sure to have two SIG leads to reduce bus factor.
      SIG leads are allowed to write the hours dedicated to organizing
      SIG activities under the R&D budget. Please in the notes mention the
      name of your SIG:
        Account: 000104
        Project: 000104
        Hour type: 00071
        Notes: Hours for X SIG

## What is the SIGâ€™s mission?
Our mission is to enrich the knowledge of our members in the topic of accelerated computing, with a focus on GPUs, and to do so we organize meetings to discuss recent developments in technology and research. We focus on technologies and expertise that are required to accelerate scientific computations, specifically by rewriting and optimizing the compute-intensive parts of the code. Furthermore, we maintain close connections with the broad research community by actively participating in national-level workshops, by inviting external speakers at the SIG meetings, and having students present their research projects. We are also involved in the teaching of GPU programming courses, and represent the first contact point for eScience engineers having issues with performance-critical code.

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?
<!--  Please transfer your SIG existing repo to this GitHub organization  --> https://github.com/NLeSC/gpu-sig

## What is the Office group of the SIG use?
<!--  help text goes here -->
GPU Computing

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2019 - April 2020 (for existing SIGs)
<!--  A simple list of activities in this period is enough.  -->

November 14, 2019. Ben gave a talk at the SIG about his idea to write a paper on the lessons learned in a decade of research software engineering GPU applications. We discussed the lessons learned and ideas within the SIG. Ben, Alessio, and Willem Jan then proceeded to write the paper together, which has been accepted at ICCS 2020 in the SE4Science track.

December 9, 2019. We co-organized a national-level tutorial on using CUDA in combination with MPI. Several members of the GPU SIG attended the tutorial to learn and some members attended to help as teaching assistants.

December 16, 2019. We co-organized a national-level workshop on GPU Research in the Netherlands. Several members of the SIG including Hanno Spreeuw and Ben van Werkhoven, as well as several of our eScience project partners, including Lars van den Haak (CHEOPS project) and Bram Veenboer (Triple A-2 project) presented their work as part of the workshop.

February 13, 2020 Felipe presented his work on a Quantum Chemistry code and got a lot of valuable feedback on how to further improve the performance of his code. This is a great example of how the SIG directly impacts eScience projects and creates knowledge utilization.

February 19, 2020. Alessio attended the GPU Hackathon Summit meeting in Bologna, Italy. Alessio attended the meeting because the GPU Computing SIG would like to organize such hackathons/workshops in the near future. On March 26, we also devoted one of the SIG meetings to discussing the options for organizing such events. Of course the Covid-19 outbreak is complicating matters, but we still plan to organize such an event in the near future either virtually or in real life. For example, the University of Sheffield is organizing a GPU virtual hackathon in July 2020 (https://gpuhackathons.org/event/sheffield-gpu-hackathon).

May 14, 2020 Alessio sent around a form to inquire interest for a new GPU Programming teaching course to be taught by Alessio and Ben, with the assistance of other members from the SIG.

Note that outside of the ones listed here we had several more informative and productive SIG meetings.

## Plans for period until end of October 2020
<!--  help text goes here  -->

- GPU Programming course for eScience engineers. Alessio and Ben have taught such courses several times, internally and externally. We are currently gathering numbers on how many people are interested and what topics to focus on. We plan to give this course sometime in the next few months.
- GPU Workshop/Hackaton, late 2020 or early next year. Idea is to invite project partners and others to submit proposals for codes that could use or improve their use of GPUs.
- Regular SIG meetings once every 3 weeks.


## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
<!--  help text goes here  -->

- More and updated Accelerated Computing expertise in our eScience projects.
- Knowledge sharing between eScience engineers working on different projects.
- A platform for asking feedback and questions to colleagues regarding compute-intensive problems.
- A GPU Programming course for eScience engineers.
