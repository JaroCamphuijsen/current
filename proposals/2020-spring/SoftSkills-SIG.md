## SIG outcomes in the period October 2019 - April 2020 
<!--  As a simple list of activities in this period is enough.  -->

We have had seven SIG sessions from 30/01/2020 up to the time of this writing. Main achievements are:\

* We have provided a place where participants feel comfortable to share knowledge and experiences related to Soft-Skills (our main target).\

\

* We have had specific sessions devoted to: \


	* Stress management, where we talked about stress mitigation and coping mechanisms. We shared experiences on how to deal with stress and we pointed out some of the main work-related causes of it (see [Minutes](https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/soft-skills/blob/master/docs/Meeting_minutes/Minutes%202020-03-12.docx) for more details).

	* Presentation skills, a session devoted to receiving advice from more experienced SIGers in the art of talking to large audiences (see [Minutes](https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/soft-skills/blob/master/docs/Meeting_minutes/Minutes%202020-05-14.docx) for main conclusions).

	* Interpersonal communication skills. On 12/03/2020, we received a 1-hour external coaching session by Michelle van den Berg on Non-Violent Communication (NVC). This activity rose the awareness of the participants on the topic and fostered some extra-SIG activities aimed to train NVC.\

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2020
<!--  help text goes here  -->

<!-- In this section, list what plans you have for this SIG. Describe each plan according to the following format:
For the title, describe your plan in just a few words. For the context, describe briefly and concretely what is the plan. -->

- **Writing of how-to document on conflict resolution**: As described above, we would like to provide as output of this SIG for next period a short document describing which actions are advised to be taken during a conflict situation. We would like to align this document with the code of conduct. Willem has already started the contacts with Lars, Mateusz, OR and DT.  

\

- **Organize role-playing activities to train conflict resolution skills**: As described previously, we would like to stir activities that will broaden the awareness across the Center about the importance of Non-Violent communication. Jens, Pablo L. And Willem are currently working on playing scripts and organising a periodic activity..

\

- **Enhance feedback after Colloquium talks**: After addressing the issue of talking to big audiences we realised that having (optional) feedback during weekly Colloquiums will be an asset to improve the presentation skills among the peers. Pablo L. and Niels have already initiated the contact with the Support Team to recruit volunteers for this task.


## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
<!--  help text goes here  -->

Our main focus for the next period is to continue providing a confortable place for people to share knowledge and experience on Soft-Skills.
 
Also, aligned with the previous section, we will provide:
 * A short how-to document on conflict resolution.  
 * A periodic role-playing activity in order to train conflict resolution skills.
 * Institutionalisation of a "colloquium master" in charge of organising feedback after the Colloquium presentations.
