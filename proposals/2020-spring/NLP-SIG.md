# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?
Natural Language Processing SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?
- Erik Tjong Kim Sang
- Jisk Attema

## What is SIGâ€™s mission?
The mission of the Natural Language Processing SIG is to improve the awareness of recent relevant natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/natural-language-processing-sig

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?
eHumanities

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2019 - April 2020 (for existing SIGs)
- **General meetings**: 
20191003 and 20200409

- **Course meetings (Deep Learning for NLP)**: 
20191007 20191014 20191021 20191028
20191104 20191111
20191202 20191209

20200305
20200518

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2020
<!--  help text goes here  -->
- **Finish course Deep Learning for NLP**: we have three [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z](video lectures) left and might want to add one or two hands-on sessions
- **Resume general meetings**: in which we discuss the progress of the running NLeSC NLP projects

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Improved awareness of natural language processing issues in current eScience projects by increased communication between knowledgeable and interested engineers
- Better chance of solving bottlenecks in these projects thanks to feedback of our team
- Enhanced understanding of recent natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers by presentations/courses of recent developments in the field
