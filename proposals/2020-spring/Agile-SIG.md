## What is the SIGâ€™s mission?

The mission of our SIG will be to introduce, teach and train in Agile methodologies. We want Agile to become common knowledge in the center and aim for engineers/MT/DT/Operations to use it when appropriate. This will contribute to the team work within the center and to the restructuring and scaling phase we will enter in the near future.

## What is the Office group of the SIG use?

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2019 - April 2020 (for existing SIGs)

As a new SIG on a new topic, the Agile SIG has started with hosting a number of presentations from member to explain exactly what Agile is, and how this is applied at the eScience Center already.

The Agile SIG has become the discussion platform for how to succesfully apply Agile methods to working at the eScience Center. Due to the Corona crisis, involvement of external people was postponed.

We are also working on setting up an Introduction to Agile course. In part due to the restructuring this is taking a bit longer than expected.

## Plans for period until end of October 2020

- **Agile/Scrum in-house training**: Generic Agile or Scrum overview course given by a professional (for example, Xebia). Possibly online.
- **Experience/implementation/problems-solving sessions**: Scrum masters, development team, projects owners will share their problems/questions and we discuss them.

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?

- In-house training (attracting at least 10 participants)
- Blogposts
- Documentation/presentation of lessons learned
