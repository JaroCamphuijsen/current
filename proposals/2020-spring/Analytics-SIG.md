# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?

Analytics

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?

- Sarah Alidoost
- Johan Hidding
- Dafne van Kuppevelt

## What is SIGâ€™s mission?

The mission of this SIG in the broadest sense, is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?

<https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG>

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?

Analytics@esciencecenter.nl

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2019 - April 2020 (for existing SIGs)

- 3 Feb. the new scope of SIG (analytics rather than statistics) is discussed with members.
- 17 Feb. a talk on uncertainty quantification is given by an external project partner.
- 18 Feb. a survey is organized to improve the content of the meetings and increase their relevance to members.

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2020

- **Monthly presentations**: Continuing the monthly meetings with 30min presentations. We aim for monthly interactive meetings where diverse speakers from in and outside the center present a topic. The topic can be either an introduction into a technique or an application where advanced analytical methods played a pivotal role. Some of the planned/upcoming meetings are:

- 17 Feb. complex systems
- 25 May. confidence intervals
- 8 May. community connection
- 22 Jun. change detection in time series
- ... Jul. uncertainty quantification
- ... Aug. numerical differentiation in the complex plane

We update the status of the meetings at [Analytics-SIG/Meeting planning](https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG/projects/1) on github.

- **Training**: Following a tutorial or an (online) course on a more specific topic in two-weekly meetings. The interested topics are:

- network theory
- statistics of machine/deep learning
- data cleaning/integration and making AI-ready data

- **Regular meeting with Tech leads**: We organized at least one meeting per each SIG period to discuss topics that are related to the technological strategy, and the project demands. The meeting is planned as:

- 14 May. discussion on SIG survey results and interested topics

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?

- Internal training on a specific topic mentioned above
- Sharing knowledge on statistics (at basic/intermediate level)
- Transfer of knowledge by inviting external speakers
- Keeping a portfolio of expertise in analytics at the center
- Making a collection of tools and resources
- Contributing to Zenodo:
  - slide presentations
