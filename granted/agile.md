## SIG outcomes in the period April 2020 - October 2020 (for existing SIGs)

The Agile SIG has become the discussion platform for how to succesfully apply Agile methods to working at the eScience Center.
Due to the Corona crisis, involvement of external people is postponed.

We are also working on setting up an [Introduction to Agile](https://github.com/escience-academy/lesson-agile-escience) course. This is progessing nicely.

- **Agile/Scrum in-house training**: Generic Agile or Scrum overview course.
- **Experience/implementation/problems-solving sessions**: NLeSC employees will share their problems/questions and we discuss them.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

- More knowledge on Agile at NLeSC
- In-house training
- Training material on Agile at NLeSC
- Blogposts
- Lunch colloqium presentations on the subject
